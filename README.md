If you have do not already have an Ubuntu 18.04 shell, please set one up through a cloud provider like AWS or GCP.

I have recorded a guide for GCP here:

After you have an Ubuntu shell, follow the instructions found in `get_started` to run automation scripts for all the tools needed in this repository.
